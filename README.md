# foopsss' ebuild repository
This is a repository created to store ebuilds I made for [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Portage), the 
package manager of [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org/). These ebuilds are maintained by me and not officially supported by the Gentoo team in any form.

# Credits
* This repo's README is inspired by the one on [ppfeufer's Gentoo overlay](https://github.com/ppfeufer/gentoo-overlay).
* The [Gentoo Devmanual](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/index.html) (a very useful resource) and the [#gentoo-dev-help](https://www.gentoo.org/get-involved/irc-channels/all-channels.html) IRC channel, where I was helped by two users, cwittlut and catcream.
